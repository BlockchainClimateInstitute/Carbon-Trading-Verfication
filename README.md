# Carbon-Trading-Verfication
This repository contains code used to the MSc Advanced Computing Thesis: Joint Study of Above Ground Biomassand Soil Organic Carbon for Total Carbon Estimation in Scotland. 

## Code Structure
Inside `scotland_carbon/src` contains our implementation:
- `train.py` trains the model
- `feature_importance.py` generates the feature importance graph for specified models
- `carbon_maps.py` provides two methods to generate carbon maps used in the report
- `grid_search.py` contains the code for performing grid search on our models
- `utils.py` contains utility functions and model definitions 


## File Structure
- `archive` contains previous work from Carla and Anish.
- `scotland_carbon` contains our implementation
